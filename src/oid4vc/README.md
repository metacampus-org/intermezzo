## OID4VC Module

Nest module exposing
[OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
(OID4VCI) and
[OpenID for Verifiable Presentations](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)
(OID4VP) over a [Credo-TS](https://credo.js.org/) agent.

- **Issuer DID**: the manager's `did:algo` (anchored on Algorand). Enforced
  by `Oid4vcAgentProvider.ensureIssuerDid` via `isDidAlgo()` — no fallback.
- **Holder binding**: the wallet-local `did:key`, pinned onto the offer at
  creation time by the manager.
- **Signing**: Vault-held; see [`libs/credo-vault-wallet`](../../libs/credo-vault-wallet/).
- **Trust model**: see [`TRUST_MODEL.md`](./TRUST_MODEL.md).

### Endpoints

App-level orchestration endpoints (Nest):

| Method | Path                                | Purpose                                    |
|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/v1/credential/issuer/configurations` | List supported credential configurations   |
| POST   | `/v1/credential/issuer/offers`         | Create a credential offer (returns QR URI) |
| GET    | `/v1/credential/issuer/sessions/:id`   | Inspect an issuance session                |
| POST   | `/v1/credential/verifier/requests`     | Create a presentation request              |
| GET    | `/v1/credential/verifier/sessions/:id` | Inspect a verification session + claims    |
| GET    | `/v1/credential/status/list/:listId`   | **Public.** Signed status list token       |
| POST   | `/v1/credential/status/revoke`         | Revoke all credentials in a session               |
| POST   | `/v1/credential/status/reactivate`     | Undo a revocation                          |

The OID4VCI/OID4VP **protocol endpoints** themselves (token, credential,
authorization, …) are mounted by Credo on its own Express routers under
`OID4VC_ISSUER_PATH` (`/oid4vci`) and `OID4VC_VERIFIER_PATH` (`/oid4vp`),
attached in `src/main.ts` *before* `setGlobalPrefix('v1')`.

### Credential formats

One configuration is advertised (see
`src/oid4vc/issuer/credential-configurations.ts`):

- `device-attestation-credential` — SD-JWT VC minted by
  `/v1/link/response`; subsequent DID update calls present this credential
  via `CredentialAuthGuard`.

The credential mapper (`Oid4vcIssuerService#buildCredentialMapper`) selects
the `OpenId4VciSignCredential` shape per the wallet's requested format and
populates it from the offer's `issuanceMetadata`.

### Revocation

Every SD-JWT VC is issued with an [IETF Token Status
List](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list/)
pointer:

```json
"status": { "status_list": { "uri": "https://host/v1/credential/status/list/f538cd53-79e5-4877-b6c2-51c09c51f8ab", "idx": 42 } }
```

Verification enforces this for free — `@sd-jwt` fetches the list, checks
its signature, reads the bit and rejects the credential unless it is `0`.
The wallet authentication guard also requires a well-formed reference to an
issuer UUID list; status-free device-attestation credentials are rejected.

Revoke by issuance session: send exactly one of `sessionId` (the local Vault
session `id`) or `credoIssuanceSessionId`. The offer response and
`GET /v1/credential/issuer/sessions` return both:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/credential/status/revoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGER_JWT" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sessionId":"<issuance-session-id>","reason":"device reported stolen"}'
```

`POST .../reactivate` with the same body reverses it. Both operations cover
all entries recorded on that session, including entries on older lists.
Revocation intent is persisted before the bits change, preventing further
issuance from that session. A failed operation remains pending: retry the
same endpoint and session id to finish it, including after a restart. The
original reason is preserved. An opposite operation while pending returns
409; finish the pending operation before reversing it. Completion/audit
write failures return an error, even when all bits already changed.

The list itself is
public, because verifiers must be able to dereference it:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/v1/credential/status/list/f538cd53-79e5-4877-b6c2-51c09c51f8ab
# Content-Type: application/statuslist+jwt
```

Each list has a permanent UUIDv4 id and 16,384 entries. Allocation elects a
new UUID list automatically when the active list fills. Credentials share
a list URI and have distinct numeric indices; indices are never recycled,
including after failed issuance. One million allocations fit in 62 lists.
The UUID in the examples is illustrative: fetch the actual URI embedded in
the credential or use its session's `statusEntries`.

Three things worth knowing:

- **The list URL is load-bearing for the life of every credential that
  points at it.** A failed status fetch fails verification, so moving or
  removing it — including by changing `OID4VC_BASE_URL` — bricks issued
  credentials. Reissuance is the only repair.
- **The list token is signed with the manager `did:algo` key**, the same
  key that signs credentials. Credo configures a single verifier for both,
  so any other signing key fails verification.
- **Fresh installations require status references for wallet authentication.**
  There is no legacy `default` list alias or status-free compatibility mode.
- **There is no suspension.** Lists use `bits: 1`; a `0x02` status would
  need `bits: 2`, and `@sd-jwt`'s validator rejects every non-zero status,
  so a suspended credential would look revoked.

This service resolves its own lists in-process rather than fetching its
own URL (`Oid4vcStatusService#installLocalStatusListFetcher`), so
wallet auth does not depend on the server reaching its public URL. Each
status check still reads Vault; the signed JWT is reused only if the
encoded status data is unchanged. Revocations committed by other instances
are observed on the next authoritative read, and Vault failures fail closed.

HTTP responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`. Tokens currently omit `ttl`
and `exp`; external verifiers that cache tokens independently can delay
revocation. Internal cache correctness does not depend on those claims.
Adding `exp` requires refreshing tokens even when no status bits change.

W3C `jwt_vc_json` credentials get **no** status claim: Credo refuses to
verify credential status for JWT VCs, so adding one would break
verification rather than enable it.

### Holder binding

1. The caller (manager-authenticated) hits `POST /v1/credential/issuer/offers`
   with the target wallet-local `did:key` as `holderDidKey`.
2. `Oid4vcIssuerService.createOffer` pins `holderDidKey` into
   `issuanceMetadata._holderDidKey` and persists it on
   `Oid4vcIssuanceSession.holderDidKey`.
3. On redemption, the credential mapper accepts the request only if the
   proof JWT's `holderBinding.didUrl` is the pinned `did:key` (or a
   fragment URL under it).
4. The issued credential's holder (`holder.didUrl` for SD-JWT VC,
   `credentialSubject.id` for W3C JWT VC) is the pinned `did:key`.

### DID methods

The agent registers two DID methods:

- **`did:algo`** — issuer side. `AlgoDidRegistrar` / `AlgoDidResolver`
  from `libs/credo-did-algo`, wired via host adapters in `algo/`.
- **`did:key`** — holder side. Credo's built-in `KeyDidRegistrar` /
  `KeyDidResolver`.

`did:key` is **never** acceptable as the issuer DID: it has no revocation
surface, no on-chain anchor, and would prevent issuer discovery via a
future trust registry (see [`TRUST_MODEL.md`](./TRUST_MODEL.md)).

### Vault-held credential signing

Ed25519 private keys for the manager identity live in HashiCorp Vault
(transit engine, `VAULT_TRANSIT_USERS_PATH`). Nothing in this module
sees private bytes:

- `VaultAskarWallet` (from `libs/credo-vault-wallet`) is an `AskarWallet`
  subclass that overrides Ed25519 `sign()` for keys registered in the
  process-wide `vaultSigningRegistry`. It calls `VaultService.sign`,
  parses `vault:v1:<base64>`, and verifies the signature locally before
  returning.
- `Oid4vcAskarModule` registers the subclass at
  `InjectionSymbols.Wallet` in place of stock `AskarModule`.
- `AlgoDidRegistrar.create` does not generate a key in Askar — it pulls
  the manager's existing Vault transit key via
  `VaultKeyProvisioningAdapter`, registers the binding, and publishes
  the on-chain document.

Per-user `did:algo`s use a different path: `AttestationsService.redeem`
calls `DidService.publishUncontrolledDid` — the manager pays the
on-chain write, but the published document is owned by the wallet's
`did:key`.

### Vault AppRole

The OID4VC subsystem does **not** provision its own AppRole. It reuses
the manager AppRole (`VAULT_ROLE_ID` / `VAULT_SECRET_ID`, the same
credentials backing `ManagerVaultTokenProvider`) via
`AlgoVaultTokenProvider`, since OID4VC operates on behalf of the
manager identity and a separate role would only duplicate Vault
policy surface area.

### Storage

Credo persists its own records inside the **Askar** wallet (required by
Credo 0.5.x). No ed25519 private material lives in Askar — Vault is the
sole custodian.

App-level mappings persisted in Vault KV:

- `oid4vc_issuance_session` / `oid4vc_verification_session` — correlate
  Credo session ids with the holder `did:key` and credential
  configuration for status queries. The issuance session also carries
  `statusEntries` — one `(listId, idx)` per credential the session issued —
  plus durable `statusChange` intent and `revokedAt` / `revokedReason` on completion.
- `intermezzo/oid4vc/status-lists/records/<id>` — one record per status
  list: a 16,384-entry bitstring (2 KiB raw; compressed size depends on
  the status distribution) and the next free index.
- `intermezzo/oid4vc/status-lists/active` — CAS-protected pointer to the
  active UUID. This record is not a public list.

Session entry appends, status transitions, and Credo state mirroring use
conditional writes. Session listing still scans Vault sequentially; it is
not a scalable million-session administration interface.

The Vault key binding map is **in-memory** (manager-only) and rebuilt on
boot by `Oid4vcAgentProvider`.
