 *     this route: the credential identifies *which* `did:key` the txn
 *     groups should be built for, and the manager Vault Transit key
 *     pre-signs the MBR `pay` only because that proof-of-possession
 *     was presented. The submit route is also gated by
 *     {@link CredentialAuthGuard}: the transactions it broadcasts
 *     are already wallet-signed (and host-pre-signed at manager
 *     positions), but the credential is still required to identify
 *     the caller's `did:key` for the server-side app-id lookup.
 *     Manager-orchestrated DID-document publishes
 *     happen at onboarding time via `DidService.publishUncontrolledDid`,
